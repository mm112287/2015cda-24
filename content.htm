<p>CMSimply content management system needs no database and saves page content in a file called content.htm. Uploaded images and files are saved in the images and downloads directories respectively.</p>

<p>Create an OpenShift free account:</p>
<p>You need an Email account to create an OpenShift free account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new">https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new</a></p>
<p>Create a Python 3 Application:</p>
<p>After you successfully create an OpenShift account and logged in, you need to create a Python 3 application. While you create such a Python 3 application, choose site namespace and use CMSimply bitbucket repository URL as your site's source code link. OpenShift will deploy your new CMSimply automatically.</p>
<p>After Python 3 application creation is completed, you can use the site name you registered to connect to your site.</p>
<p>Modify administrator's password:</p>
<p>The first matter to do with your new site is to modify the administrator's password. The default administrator password is "admin", use this default password to login to your new site and modify password.</p>
<p>Add content to your site:</p>
<p>CMSimply use html's h1, h2 and h3 tags to seperate pages, all these heading tags content identify the associated page title. H1, h2 and h3 heading also treated as hierarchical pages. The h1 is the most outter page, h2 page is under h1 and h3 page is under h2 etc. All pages are in sequential order, therefore if you want to add another h1 page after some h1+h2+h3 pages group, you can either add this h1 page after the last h3 page or locate this h1 page before some page after the so-called h3 page.</p>
<p>Backup your site:</p>
<p>On OpenShitf:</p>
<p>Save content.htm, images and downloads directories under data directory.</p>
<p>On localhost:</p>
